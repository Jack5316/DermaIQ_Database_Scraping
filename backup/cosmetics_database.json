Our Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion is clinically proven to moisturise deeply* to soothe dry skin with the first application, and to keep it restored for 3 weeks**. Our skin is the barrier between our bodies and the outside world, and the health of our skin is essential to our overall well-being. At Vaseline, we believe that healthy skin starts with deep-restoring moisture, which is why our lotion's formula works to heal and soothe dry skin. The micro-droplets of Vaseline Jelly penetrate deep down within the stratum corneum to lock in moisture and form a protective layer on your skin. This sealing barrier speeds up the skin\u2019s natural recovery process. Apply Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion daily, letting its rich yet quick-absorbing formula provide intense moisturisation to your skin and leave it delicately fragranced with a fresh aloe vera scent. *based on 4-week treatment clinical study **within the stratum corneum",

        "product_details": "ALREADY HAVE THE PRE-SHOW GLOW REUSABLE APPLICATOR? THIS IS ITS ACCOMPANYING TREATMENT REFILL. GIVE IT TO ME QUICK: Rihanna\u2019s secret for smooth, glowing skin starts with Pre-Show Glow and its reusable applicator. The key to glowing skin is exfoliation-the gentle removal of old, dull cells on the surface of skin. This powerful duo helps transform skin by smoothing and refining the look of pores, while brightening and evening texture over time. KEY BENEFITS: This concentrated formula is packed with 10% AHAs, which provide chemical exfoliation to loosen and lift dead skin cell build-up from the skin\u2019s surface The unique reusable applicator delivers gentle physical exfoliation Its gentle formula leaves skin ultra-soft, radiant, and makeup-ready-with no downtime, right at home A potent combination of fruit enzymes and extracts helps clarify, purify, and smooth Features a light, fruity-floral scent inspired by pomegranate and hibiscus HOW TO USE: Wet reusable applicator and your face with water. Pour a small amount of solution into the centre of the wet applicator. Gently scrub face with the applicator for 30-60 seconds, working the solution into a plush lather. Rinse skin, pat dry, then follow with toner. If using during the day, make sure to follow up with Fenty Skin Hydra Vizor to protect your skin from the sun as AHAs can increase UV sensitivity. For best results, use Pre-Show Glow twice a week with the included applicator. Those with sensitive skin may want to start by applying with fingers or use once a week. Side note-you\u2019ll want to wash the included applicator. Just toss it in your washing machine with the rest of your laundry, making sure to place it in a delicates bag. Use cool water on a gentle cycle. Lay flat to air dry (do not stretch). MADE WITH: 10% AHAs: Glycolic acid, citric acid, and lactic acid help fade the look of dark spots and reduce the look of pores, while improving the skin\u2019s moisture content. Rooibos: Rich in AHAs and zinc; revitalizes and renews Pomegranate, Papaya, & Cranberry enzymes: Help digest, lift, and loosen damaged surface cells Barbados Cherry (acerola) & Hibiscus extracts: Rich in vitamin C; help to clarify and purify WHY PRE-SHOW GLOW IS MOST WANTED: Clean, vegan, gluten-free, & earth-conscious. Its protective outer box is recyclable. The bottle and cap are recyclable. When you\u2019re done, rinse the bottle, separate the bottle and cap, and recycle both. The reusable applicator is made of 80% plant fibres and is machine-washable HAZARDS AND CAUTIONS: For external use only. Use as directed. This product contains active ingredients; we suggest patch-testing a small amount on forearm. Sunburn alert: this product contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product for a week afterwards. Avoid eye area. In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately.",

From mild, occasionally dry skin driven by ageing, weather fluctuations or just life! To dry patches and skin dryness, Dove has got you covered. Dove Advanced Care Nourishing Silk body wash transforms even the driest skin in just one shower leaving you with silky-soft skin for 24hrs. Unlike ordinary body washes, Dove Advanced Care is made with 24hour Renewing MicroMoisture. A ground-breaking new technology from Dove that deposits millions of tiny but powerfully moisturising droplets that, instead of getting washed off, absorb deeply and continuously work with your skin's natural renewal process to strengthen your skin's barrier and help retain and boost moisture, even after you shower. This moisturising body wash helps you turn every shower into an act of self-care, giving you 24hours of replenished, silky-soft skin. This formula uses a blend of naturally-derived mild cleansers and skin natural nourishers to gently cleanse your skin and nourish your microbiome. It's also is free from sulfate SLES, has 94%* biodegradable ingredients and is packaged in 100% recycled plastic bottles**. *94% of ingredients break down into carbon dioxide, water & minerals (OECD test methods 301,302 and/or 310). **bottle excluding cap and labels\"",

Formulated with Vegetal oil shield, a blend of 4 botanical oils* that mimics skin\u2019s own natural lipid composition, it forms a protective veil that hydrates and nourishes all dry and damaged areas. **Botanical oils: camellia, squalane, jojoba, eucalyptus Why is it special? \u2022 Certified clean, vegan balm with only 8 carefully selected ingredients \u2022 Enriched with a special blend of 4 botanical oils, including Japanese camellia oil, for intense hydration and nourishment. \u2022 Can be applied anywhere and anytime (face, hands, lips, heels, cuticles, eye area, elbows, etc.) for quick relief of damaged skin. \u2022 A high-quality, stable formula made from just 4 supporting ingredients** **Botanical oils: camellia, squalane, jojoba, eucalyptus A UNIQUE COMPOSITION OF STAR INGREDIENTS Goto Islands camellia seed oil: Rich in oleic acid, this precious Japanese oil is very similar to the fatty acids found naturally in the skin and is used by SHISEIDO in his WASO Calmellia Multi Relief SOS Balm for its amazing benefits for skin and hair. Acts as an emollient to moisturize the skin, protecting hair fibers from damage while enhancing hair's natural shine. Botanical squalane oil: Squalane mimics squalene, which is naturally biosynthesized in the body, and is an important component of human sebum, so it has an incredible affinity for skin. Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil: Known for its aromatherapy properties. Jojoba seed oil: Jojoba oil is a powerful emollient that moisturizes and mimics the wax esters found in the skin's protective hydrolipid film. Four supporting components: Tocopherol This natural form of Vitamin E prevents ingredients from oxidizing and keeps the formula fresh. Dextrin palmitate This plant-based compound acts as a natural thickener that adjusts the texture of the oil in your formula. Triisostearin This is the only ingredient that is not naturally derived and is a blend of glycerin and the fatty acid stearic acid. It improves the texture of the balm and gives it a rich, smooth feel. Zea Mays Starch This ingredient naturally derived from corn gives the balm a smooth texture and a non-greasy finish. Small but strong! \u2022 Clinically Proven 8-Hour Continuous Hydration(1) \u2022 Up to 47% improvement in roughness on multiple areas (face, hands, lips, heels, cuticles) in just 3 hours(2) Proven to improve hair shine by 30% (3) and extend hair moisture for 4 hours (3). \u2022 93% improvement in rough skin in 4 weeks Apply and nourish! It can be applied anywhere and anytime (face, hands, lips, heels, cuticles, eye area, elbows, etc.) for quick relief of damaged skin. Taking care of the environment is also your priority A clean formula: This 90% natural origin* balm is a minimalist formula with only 8 ingredients carefully selected for their skin benefits. * calculated based on the ISO16128 standard. Environmentally friendly packaging: The packaging material was carefully selected. Plastic-free packaging thanks to aluminium packages and cases made from paper from sustainably managed forests. Vegan Formula: Formulated without animal-derived/animal-derived ingredients and in line with Shiseido's Animal Welfare Policy.
