Dove Advanced Care Pampering body wash is a rich and creamy moisturising Body Wash that works to deeply nourish as it cleanses. Unlike other shea butter products, Dove Pampering Body Wash has a moisturising formula that contains a unique blend of skin-natural nutrients to give you the Dove care you know and love. Unlike ordinary body washes, Dove Advanced Care is made with 24hour Renewing MicroMoisture. A ground-breaking new technology from Dove that deposits millions of tiny but powerfully moisturising droplets that, instead of getting washed off, absorb deeply and continuously work with your skin's natural renewal process to strengthen your skin's barrier and help retain and boost moisture, even after you shower. With a cosy, irresistible fragrance of shea butter and warm vanilla scent, this moisturising body wash pampers skin with a foamy lather that will indulge your senses and moisturise skin. And it doesn’t stop there - this formula uses a blend of naturally-derived mild cleansers and skin natural nourishers to gently cleanse your skin and nourish your microbiome. It's also free from sulfate SLES, has 94%* biodegradable ingredients and is packaged in 100% recycled plastic bottles**. *94% of ingredients break down into carbon dioxide, water & minerals (OECD test methods 301, 302, 310). **bottle excluding cap and labels This item has been successfully added to your list. x Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to search Message Dialog Maximum basket size reached Out of stock placeholder...

Dove Advanced Care Pampering body wash is a rich and creamy moisturising Body Wash that works to deeply nourish as it cleanses. Unlike other shea butter products, Dove Pampering Body Wash has a moisturising formula that contains a unique blend of skin-natural nutrients to give you the Dove care you know and love. Unlike ordinary body washes, Dove Advanced Care is made with 24hour Renewing MicroMoisture. A ground-breaking new technology from Dove that deposits millions of tiny but powerfully moisturising droplets that, instead of getting washed off, absorb deeply and continuously work with your skin's natural renewal process to strengthen your skin's barrier and help retain and boost moisture, even after you shower. With a cosy, irresistible fragrance of shea butter and warm vanilla scent, this moisturising body wash pampers skin with a foamy lather that will indulge your senses and moisturise skin. And it doesn’t stop there - this formula uses a blend of naturally-derived mild cleansers and skin natural nourishers to gently cleanse your skin and nourish your microbiome. It's also free from sulfate SLES, has 94%* biodegradable ingredients and is packaged in 100% recycled plastic bottles**. *94% of ingredients break down into carbon dioxide, water & minerals (OECD test methods 301, 302, 310). **bottle excluding cap and labels Suitable for Suitable for all skin types How to use To fully let go and relax into the pampering moment, squeeze a generous amount of this Dove Advanced Care Pampering body wash into your palms. Spread all over your body and work into a lather. Then allow the luscious shea butter and warm vanilla scent to fill your shower.

From mild, occasionally dry skin driven by ageing, weather fluctuations or just life! To dry patches and skin dryness, Dove has got you covered. Dove Advanced Care Deeply Nourishing body wash transforms even the driest skin in just one shower leaving it feeling lotion-soft skin for 24hrs. Unlike ordinary body washes, Dove Advanced Care is made with 24hour Renewing MicroMoisture. A ground-breaking new technology from Dove that deposits millions of tiny but powerfully moisturising droplets that, instead of getting washed off, absorb deeply and continuously work with your skin's natural renewal process to strengthen your skin's barrier and help retain and boost moisture, even after you shower. This moisturising body wash helps you turn every shower into an act of self-care, giving you 24hours of replenished, lotion-soft skin. This formula uses a blend of naturally-derived mild cleansers and skin natural nourishers to gently cleanse your skin and nourish your microbiome. It's also free from sulfate SLES, has 98%* biodegradable ingredients and is packaged in 100% recycled plastic bottles**. *98% of ingredients break down into carbon dioxide, water & minerals (OECD test methods 301,302 and/or 310). **bottle excluding cap and labels"" This item has been successfully added to your list. x Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to search Message Dialog Maximum basket size reached Out of stock placeholder...

From mild, occasionally dry skin driven by ageing, weather fluctuations or just life! To dry patches and skin dryness, Dove has got you covered. Dove Advanced Care Deeply Nourishing body wash transforms even the driest skin in just one shower leaving it feeling lotion-soft skin for 24hrs. Unlike ordinary body washes, Dove Advanced Care is made with 24hour Renewing MicroMoisture. A ground-breaking new technology from Dove that deposits millions of tiny but powerfully moisturising droplets that, instead of getting washed off, absorb deeply and continuously work with your skin's natural renewal process to strengthen your skin's barrier and help retain and boost moisture, even after you shower. This moisturising body wash helps you turn every shower into an act of self-care, giving you 24hours of replenished, lotion-soft skin. This formula uses a blend of naturally-derived mild cleansers and skin natural nourishers to gently cleanse your skin and nourish your microbiome. It's also free from sulfate SLES, has 98%* biodegradable ingredients and is packaged in 100% recycled plastic bottles**. *98% of ingredients break down into carbon dioxide, water & minerals (OECD test methods 301,302 and/or 310). **bottle excluding cap and labels"" Suitable for Suitable for all skin types How to use To get the most out of this moisturising body wash formula, reach for Dove Advanced Care Deeply Nourishing body wash when in the bath or shower and squeeze a generous amount into your palms. Massage the moisturizing body wash onto your skin, taking a moment to enjoy the rich lather before rinsing off to reveal lotion-soft skin. Hazards and Cautions Caution: Avoid contact with eyes.
