# Fixing Ingredients List in Cosmetics Database

This guide provides instructions for fixing the ingredients list column in the cosmetics database CSV file.

## Problem

In the current `cosmetics_database.csv`:
1. The `ingredients_list` column is empty for many products
2. The `ingredients` column contains raw HTML and other extraneous content
3. Unicode characters and formatting issues make analysis difficult

## Solution

We've created three scripts to fix these issues:

1. `fix_sample.py`: Tests the fix on a small random sample (50 products)
2. `final_fix_ingredients.py`: Processes the entire database in batches

## Instructions

### Option 1: Process a Sample First (Recommended)

```bash
python3 fix_sample.py
```

This will:
- Select 50 random products
- Fix their ingredients data
- Save to `sample_fixed_cosmetics_database_TIMESTAMP.csv`
- Show statistics for the sample

Review the output to confirm the ingredients are being extracted correctly.

### Option 2: Process the Entire Database

```bash
python3 final_fix_ingredients.py
```

This will:
- Process all 3,638 products in batches of 100
- Create a backup of the original file
- Save progress periodically to `progress_fixed_database_TIMESTAMP.csv`
- Save final output to `fixed_cosmetics_database_TIMESTAMP.csv` and `.json`
- Display statistics about the fixed data

The script takes approximately 5-10 minutes to run depending on your system.

## Verification

After processing, check the fixed database:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('fixed_cosmetics_database_TIMESTAMP.csv')
df[df['ingredients_list'].notna()].sample(5)[['product_name', 'ingredients_count', 'ingredients_list']]
```

## Expected Results

- Approximately 30-40% of products should have properly extracted ingredients lists
- Each product with ingredients should have:
  - A cleaned ingredients string in the `ingredients` column
  - A count of ingredients in the `ingredients_count` column
  - A comma-separated list of ingredients in the `ingredients_list` column

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check:
1. CSV formatting (quoting issues)
2. Memory consumption (large dataframes)
3. Partial results in the progress files

## Notes

- The JSON output format contains the ingredients as actual arrays
- The scripts perform several text cleaning operations:
  - Remove HTML tags
  - Extract the actual ingredients section
  - Normalize separators and whitespace
  - Split by commas to create a proper list
